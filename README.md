# Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js installed. I'm using version 8.x

```
git clone https://github.com/onyxrev/currentsee.git
cd currentsee
```

To install the binary globally on your system, run:

```
npm install -g .
```

Now you can run that anywhere you like:

```
currentsee
```

To customize the confg file, copy the example to your home directory as `.currentsee`:

```
cp example_config.json ~/.currentsee
```
